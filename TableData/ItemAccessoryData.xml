This table file is used to overwrite the game's hardcoded item accessory table.

Refer to: https://ffhacktics.com/wiki/Accessory_Secondary_Data

You can use this file as a base to edit Accessory data in your mod.
Simply copy this file to your mod's folder under FFTIVC/tables/<enhanced/classic/combined>/ItemAccessoryData.xml.

IMPORTANT: You are free to remove everything and **SHOULD ONLY LEAVE ELEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE EDITED** to avoid conflicts between mods.
Only properties that are actually included in this file will be tracked as edited. Properties not edited will inherit their
value from the original table or, from other mods making changes depending on mod order.

IMPORTANT 2: The Id property must NOT be removed for nodes that you're leaving here!

For available flags, refer to https://github.com/Nenkai/fftivc.utility.modloader/blob/master/fftivc.utility.modloader.Interfaces/Tables/Structures/ITEM_ACCESSORY_DATA.cs
