<!--
This table file is used to overwrite the game's hardcoded monster job command table.

Refer to: https://ffhacktics.com/wiki/Monster_Skills

You can use this file as a base to edit Monster Job Command data in your mod.
Simply copy this file to your mod's folder under FFTIVC/tables/<enhanced/classic/combined>/MonsterJobCommandData.xml.

IMPORTANT: You are free to remove everything and **SHOULD ONLY LEAVE ELEMENTS THAT YOU HAVE EDITED** to avoid conflicts between mods.
Only properties that are actually included in this file will be tracked as edited. Properties not edited will inherit their
value from the original table or, from other mods making changes depending on mod order.

IMPORTANT 2: The Id property must NOT be removed for nodes that you're leaving here!

IMPORTANT 3: You do not need to worry about setting ExtendMonsterAbilityIdFlagBits.
The loader will fill these according to ids. You're free to use ids 0-512 directly.

For available flags, refer to https://github.com/Nenkai/fftivc.utility.modloader/blob/master/fftivc.utility.modloader.Interfaces/Tables/Structures/MONSTER_JOB_COMMAND_DATA.cs

NOTE: Innate abilities for monsters may be set with their Job Data
